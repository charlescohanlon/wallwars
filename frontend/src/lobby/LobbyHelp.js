      Wallwars is an online 2-player strategy game. The player who gets to their
      goal before first wins. You can place walls to reshape the terrain to your
      advantage.
    </h6>
    <h6>
      WallWars is inspired by board games like Blockade and Quoridor. The main
      difference is that in WallWars there is no limit to how many walls you can
      place, and moves are more flexible (for instance, you can move and place a
      wall in the same turn).
