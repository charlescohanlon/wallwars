      In puzzles, you are put in a specific situation and you have to find a
      winning move. A winning move is a move that guarantees winning no matter
      what the opponent does. If there are multiple winning moves, only the one
      that wins in the fewest turns is accepted. If there are multiple winning
      moves that win in the minimum number of steps, then any of them should be
      accepted. The puzzle ends when you have reached the goal.
